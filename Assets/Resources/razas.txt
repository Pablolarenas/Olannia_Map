They are the largest race in the known world, the main rulers, nobles and soldiers of the realms. The protagonists of this new era.\n\n 
The myth says that humans were once a mighty race of deigods called Primordials, which were cursed by their brothers, the Sultari, during the Firts Era, becoming mortals and losing their power and direct link with the creating forces of the world.\n\n
Across the ages, men have populated most of Amoss and Kerak territories, building towns, realms and even, empires. Although, they have suffered the tyranny of powerful dynasties as Sultarians and Dragons, serving them as slaves and facing them as rebels, benig able to overthown their oppression.\n\n
In the wild areas of the world, men have settled as nomad clans, living among the wild nature, having occasional contact with the civilization.\n\n
Nowadays, humnas rule most of the kingdoms, leading their churches, trading and sailing across the seas, exploring the arcane sciences and indomit lands of Zera and, overall, spinning the wheel of history though the perfection the art of war.\n\n

Dwarves live along all Amoss and Kerak human lands, being active and respected members of their societies, as renowbed smiths, warriors and artisans. \n\n
Despite their status, all dwarves share pain and shame in their memories; being all of them exiled survivors from their destroyed homelands. \n\n
During the Flaming Wars, their legendary cities fell under the tyranny of the dragon lords, forcing them to seek sanctuary to the realms of men. Along the centuries, they ended merging their culture and lore with their hosts.\n\n
In the wild mountains, barbaric dwarven clans continue living according to ancient traditions, calling themselves true dwarves and seeing their civilzed relatives as weak or even traitors.\n\n
Despite their tragic past, dwarves are proud of their glorious heritage and most of them keep their old ways and faith. \n\n
Dwarven cities are renowned among historians and adventurers alike due their culture, treasures and legacy,  buried in the deep heart of the old mountains of Amoss. There, where even the most skilled adventurers don't dare to explore.

Across the millennia, the extreme lands of the world have remained unexplored by men. And there are good reason for that. The extreme weather, geography and the wild and dangerous creatures that inhabit in those forgotten lands makes the task a suicidal expedition.\n\n 

According to some beliefs, this hostile corner of the world is inhabited by forest folks: pure incarnations of the Primordials, who blossomed to the world during the Portal Wars, to protect the Legacy from the extraplanar menace. However, the truth is, no one can give credit to the legend in the current days. Their existence remains uncertain.\n\n

Some historians have written that the forest folks remained in their lands living in a constant communion with the forces of nature after the Fall of the Sultari. But, there’s no evidence in the eyes of the men that can prove this theory. Others claim to have seen them in ancient forests near the mountains. However, such stories are often dismissed by people.In this way, the existence of them has ended up being nothing more than a myth, commonly heard from superstitious villagers.\n\n

Although, in the last years, due to the sailing development, men have been able to navigate beyond the troubled seas, getting closer to the "edges" of the world, and claiming have seen strange creatures in the wild archipelagos  of the southern Evergreen and the new lands of Zera.

Feared by common folks and respected by few smart lords which value a good and strong sword, Half-Orcs are paradoxical people. Although they are not Orcs, they still carrying fragments of the demonic blood of their relatives on their veins.\n\n
The first Half-Orcs were seen in small towns after the attacks made by the Orc gangs once they arrived Amoss. As result of the rape, they didn't survive more than one day among the furious villagers, being immediately sacrificed by them. Despite this, after centuries and wars, they started to be "accepted" in some cosmopolitan cultures, especially as soldiers and mercenaries.\n\n
Nowadays, the half orcs are seen as furious warriors, efficient mercenaries, village thugs, unwanted commoners and part of the Blood Clan's army of Ramneshk, usually seen as despicable weak bastards by the Orcs. Despite their orch heritage, just a very few Half-Orcs have been "respected" by them, serving as agents, spies and soldiers of the horde.
This is probably the main reason why most Half-Orcs travel along the realms seeking a new life, avoiding the land of their fathers.\n\n
Despite their intimidating aspect and bad reputation, some Half-Orcs have lived among peaceful humans, dwarves and Halflings, being raised as friendly and loyal members to their community.\n\n\

Blessed by the gods, Aasimars are probably the rarest of all races, considered, by the few ones that know them, as living miracles. Aasimar are humans with blood of their godly ancestors.\n\n
According to the myth, when the Sultari cursed their brothers, the Firstborns, transforming them in to humans, some of them conserved part of their old divine power. Over the eras, the blood of the Aasimar started to dissolve, although, some families were more resilient, preserving their lineage.\n\n
On the other hand, the recorded history of the realms alludes of some Aasimars born in commoner families, non-related with the old bloodlines, suggesting that their existence is also promoted by the will of the gods.\n\n
Nowadays, the Aasimars are almost extinct. The common folk knows that the last ones live as monks and priests in the temple-city of Kha. An isolated sanctuary located in the Hollow Coast, hidden from all kingdoms, but loyal to the Ish-Kan crown, serving it as respected oracles and protectors.\n\n

Tieflings has their origin during the tyrannical reign of the Sultari. During that dark ages, the fallen celestials mixed their blood with their human slaves to expand their lineage along the empire. The offspring of that rapes were the first Tieflings, known by their human relatives as "Plague-blooded".\n\n
Living among the slaves and the noble tyrants, the Tieflings were always pariahs in both worlds. Treated as inferiors by their fathers and a source of shame by their mothers. Rapidly, Tieflings understood that their destiny resided only in their will and audacity.\n\n
Along the eras, the Tieflings has lived as a nomad culture. Without kingdom or nation, surviving among wars and chaos, but learning from them. Using their divine, or cursed, heritage to become extraordinary spellcasters, merchants, spies, thieves or even assassins, serving several noblemen, without any sense of loyalty. Others, have tried to live a charmed life, making extraordinary efforts to blend in the human society. Unfortunately, without too much success. Similar than Half Orcs, Tieflings are seen as a manifestation of evil or even bad luck in the best cases.Despite this, Tieflings are being successful in their survival efforts, preserving their lineage across the centuries and the falling of several kingdoms, building their own space in the world.\n\n

Much more sociable than dwarves, but less chaotic than Halflings, Gnomes understand the languages of nature as well as the Arcanum, being one of the most wise and cultured folks in the realms.\n\n
After de Portal Wars, the gnome families gathered in Ish-khan, contributing to the development of the arcane society. Centuries later, they crossed The Exile, establishing their enclave in the kingdom of Kamyr, serving the realm as respected and trustful advisors and keepers of the words.\n\n
After the fall of Kewlvor, they spread along the Sea of Miracles, expanding their communities wherever the rumours of a secret knowledge could emerge.\n\n
Nowadays, Gnomes are common folks in the western kingdoms, specially in small towns and cities next to woods and countryside. Well received in most places excepting Veross and Zav-Azur, their both mental and social aptitudes make them suitable for basically any profession. Although, they prefer to invest their time among scrolls, potions and wild, studying the mysteries of the world.\n\n
