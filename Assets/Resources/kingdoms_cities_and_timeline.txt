The Free Kingdoms lead the expansion of the known world to the savage continent of Zera, placing their colonies in the Castobello Islands. That's why their cities are very attractive destinations for travellers, adventurers and fortune seekers. However, due the constant conflicts of interest among the feudal families, the nation is particularly attractive for mercenaries and desertors from other realms who are willing for selling their steel for all sort of purpuses.\n \n 

Due its merchant nature, the realm is inhabited by several races. Theres a few cities, though,  where small folk are seen as suspiciuos individuals, dwarven are trated  as cheap workforce or orcs are feared. Despite all, in general, the Brother Kingdoms are considered an open society to anyone who bring fortune to their pockets, as long the visitors doesnt mess whith the local lords and their interests."

Almost 2000 years ago, humans from the west, crossed the Sea of Miracles and populated the lost Sultarian ruins in the Plague Vale, a very rich land blessed by the Faltyr sierra. The human clans founded their firts cities over the Sultarian ruins without knowing the tragedy of their previous rulers.\n \n 


Farla is world-renowned for its tradition in the fields of engineering and alchemy. Given its antiquity and the access obtained to the knowledge of the Sultarians, Farla was able to rapidly develop its culture and technology, transforming itself into a prosperous and powerful kingdom.
However, the price that the kingdom has had to pay, for the legacy of the Sultarians has been high. It is said that the lands of Faltyr are cursed and that those who inhabit their surroundings inevitably fall under the spell of the mountain, which according to the myth tell, can manipulate the will of people leading them to dementia.
It is believed that it is due to the curse of the mountain, that the four ancient kingdoms that inhabited the area: Fharla, Zav-Azur, Ebironia and Muldar lived in constant wars, which ended up destroying them, being Farla, the only one of those kingdoms that still stands.\n \n
Since the Rise of the Sultari, 20 years ago approx., the realm has been restisting the Zavarian invation, being supported by their allies in the Black Iron Coast and Veross. Despite their assistance, the kingdom is living very critical times; a step closer to fall. \n \n


Along with Zav-Azur, Arannia and the Great Archipelago, Fharla concentrates the highest population of tieflings in the world, being active participants of several levels of their society."
